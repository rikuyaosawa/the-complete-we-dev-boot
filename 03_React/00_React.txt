 - JSX - Markup inside JavaScript
 	is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write
	HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
	Although there are other ways to write components,
	most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

React starter template with JSX

	import React from "react";
	import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

	ReactDOM.render(
	<div>

	</div>,
	document.getElementById("root")
	);


Rules
 - HTML elemts (such as className) must be camel-cased.
